Introduction of the Project:
Mall customer segmentation via K-means clustering involves the process of categorizing shoppers into distinct groups based on similarities in their purchasing behaviors, preferences, and demographic characteristics. 
This method employs the K-means algorithm, which partitions the customers into clusters, aiming to minimize the variation within each group and maximize the differences between them. 
Through the analysis of various data points such as shopping frequency, average spending, types of products purchased, and other behavioral patterns, K-means clustering identifies homogeneous clusters within the customer base. 
This approach enables malls and retailers to gain a deeper understanding of their clientele, facilitating the customization of marketing strategies, product offerings, and even store layouts tailored to the specific needs and preferences of each segment. 
Ultimately, this segmentation technique fosters a more personalized and targeted approach, enhancing the overall shopping experience and driving customer satisfaction and loyalty.
